          <p>
            The word "computer" is used to refer to absolutely any technique
            that is able to perform at least some kind of software operation
            from the calculator to the workstation. We will not consider them
            all, but we will only talk about the most popular types of
            computers. What they are, what are the differences and for whom this
            or that species is suitable.

            home or in the office. That is, it is not designed to move from one
            place to another - where they put it, it's there.

            which includes a screen, and "brains", and a keyboard with a mouse
            replacer (touchpad), and even built- in speakers. And most of the
            models at the top of the screen have a webcam.

          <h2>Recover Deleted Files</h2>
          <p>
            All of us from time to time we clean the computer of unnecessary
            files. And sometimes, it turns out that the necessary files, such as
            documents or photos, are deleted. The easiest way to recover them is
            to open the Recycle Bin, find the deleted files and restore them.
            But what if the basket is cleaned? Here, the R-Studio program will
            help us. It will help us to find a way out of the problem.

            How to know the temperature of the processor, video card and other
            computer components
          </h2>
          <img class="photo" src="/img/image_2023-06-08_18-41-14.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            There is no need to monitor the temperature of the video card or
            processor, since modern computers are protected against overheating.
            But if all the same, your computer starts to turn off with no result
            (especially when some powerful game is started), or the computer
            started to make a lot of noise (meaning the work of the cooler,
            especially it is noticeable on laptops) then it is worth to look at
            the temperature of the devices. Perhaps this is all due to
            overheating of the cores (processors) or video card. If the
            diagnosis is still confirm the overheating, then most likely the
            computer is clogged with dust. Based on my experience, I can say
            that this is the main reason for overheating.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            So, to find out what kind of temperature devices usually use special
            programs such as AIDA, CoreTemp, HWMonitor and others.

            <h2>Proper use of solid state drives. Moving from HDD to SSD</h2>
            <p>
              Now SSD is actively becoming cheaper, and this trend will continue
              in the future. And many users decide on the purchase and
              installation of SSD in your computer or laptop. The main motive
              for why it is worth doing is to increase the speed of the
              operating system load several times, as well as the overall
              increase in PC performance.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As for the reliability of SSD compared to old good hard disks, it
              is difficult to judge, because it depends on many factors and
              often depends no longer on the absence of moving parts in solid
              state drives, as the producers are shouting, but on the banal
              reliability of the electronic part itself, the stability of the
              firmware, built-in controller.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              According to the statistics of the leading data centers available
              today, the probability of SSD and HDD failures is comparable, so
              the factor of increased reliability as a reason for switching to
              SSD will not be taken into account for the time being.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              When installing an SSD on a desktop computer, you should be aware
              that all manufactured solid-state drives have a 2.5-inch form
              factor, so you'll need to use an adapter to install it instead of
              3.5-inch HDDs. However, it is usually available in a set of drives
              of famous brands.

            <h2>The lifetime of your hard drive</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              If there is something to break, then it will necessarily break. A
              rhetorical question - when? Everything is very simple.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>It will happen as always at the most unsuitable moment.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              A special case is the failure of a hard drive, on which we store
              gigabytes of personal information, working materials, etc.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              According to data from the company BackBlaze, which was one of the
              first to develop a cloud-based backup service without volume
              limitation.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              They organized their data storage center on the basis of ordinary
              consumer hard drives, because it turned out to be the cheapest
              way.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As a result, they took more than 27,000 hard drives, which were
              represented mainly by three manufacturers: Seagate, Westem
              Digital, Hitachi. They are also world leaders in the production
              and sale of hard drives.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              After four years of BackBlaze service on their blog, an article
              appeared in which they shared some curious facts regarding the
              survivability of hard disks and their reliability in conditions of
              active exploitation.
            </p>

            <br />
            <h2>Curious facts</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              It turned out that in the first year of operation 5.1% of hard
              disks fail, then this figure is gradually increasing, and by the
              age of four every fifth hard disk is dead.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              If we try to extrapolate this schedule for the fifth and sixth
              year, it tums out that only half of the hard disks will survive
              until their sixth birthday. Apparently, it's not for nothing that
              the longest warranty that can be found on hard disks is 5 years,
              and most manufacturers even now give a guarantee only for 1-2
              years.

            <h2>Motherboard</h2>
            <p>
                A motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) found in general purpose microcomputers and other expandable
                systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the
                central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.
            </p>
            <div class="border"></div>
            <p>
                Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems such as the central processor, the chipset's
                input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for general purpose use.
